ðŸŒŒ **Solar System Orbital Visualization**

This Python script creates a 3D animated visualization of the orbits of the eight planets and some moons around the Sun. It models realistic orbital motion using actual planetary data, providing an engaging and educational view of our Solar System in motion.

ðŸ”§ **What the Script Does**

The script simulates and animates:

 **Planetary Orbits**: Elliptical paths of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune based on their semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and orbital periods.

- **Moon Orbits**: Motion of Earthâ€™s Moon and several of Jupiterâ€™s moons with their own scaled orbits and periods.

- **Orbital Inclinations**: 3D tilt of orbits relative to the ecliptic plane.

- **Real-Time Positioning**: Calculates and updates planet and moon positions dynamically over time.

- **Sun and Stars**: A glowing Sun at the center and a starry background enhance visual realism.

- **3D Camera Rotation**: Smooth rotation of the viewing angle to provide a dynamic perspective.

- **Scaling**: All orbits and distances are scaled to fit nicely within the 3D plot for clear visualization.
